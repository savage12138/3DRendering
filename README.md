# 3D Rendering
Each folder contains a main script file, a parameter file, a raw triangle file, a rotate function file, a translate function file, and 1 or 2 output image files, modelname.m is the main script, modelname_parameters.m is the parameter file. The main script files are identical except the input raw files are different. You can just run the main script, the matlab will start rendering the 2D image. If you want to change the parameters, you will need to change them in the parameter file associated with the main script. I thought about making the script request manual input in the parameters, like variable = input('Enter variable = '), but I realized there are so many parameters. It would be easier to make a parameter file and just run it in the main script to import all the parameters in the beginning of the script. Feel free to change any of the parameters in the parameter file. Last note, the eiffel model will take about 40 seconds to render.
